  ## Description

  This application takes an existing budget tracker application and update it to allow for offline access and functionality.  The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online.

  ## Motivation

  This application was implemented to give users a fast and easy way to track their money.  Allowing them to have access to that information at any time is important.  Having offline functionality is paramount to the seccess of an application that handles users financial information.
